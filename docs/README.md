## Fork consolidation and retirement

BookshelfNG 0.4.21.71 and ChaptarrNG v0.9.977 remain the latest public app releases. ChaptarrNG main is [501624e7](https://github.com/snapetech-org/chaptarrng/commit/501624e7b1edf67064ee981fe6aac349cfa26253). A candidate-only Debian bridge recipe now builds the ChaptarrNG archive under the existing bookshelfng package identity; no bridge package is published or approved for upgrade. Real dpkg/systemd handoff, PPA, representative-data rollback, other channel acceptance, feature parity, and operator sign-off remain open. Keep BookshelfNG in service and keep publication frozen.

The path inventory is still pinned to ChaptarrNG snapshot 4d9c4b2d; its open-path counts are historical and must be re-reviewed against current main before retirement.
