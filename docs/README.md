## Fork consolidation and retirement

Current status (2026-10-20): BookshelfNG `0.4.21.71` remains its final public release and ChaptarrNG `v0.9.977` its latest. ChaptarrNG source snapshot `cfaaa418199662fad7d209aa5f4e62bceb723148` contains the row-format author-editor handoff, root-folder profile resets, stale-request protection and retry controls for book details, and monitoring failure feedback that keeps bulk selections retryable. The BookshelfNG workflow regression suite and frontend type-check passed on the exact-head Build; platform, installer, and .NET test jobs are running in [39517289908](https://github.com/snapetech-org/chaptarrng/actions/runs/39517289908). CodeQL, Security Analysis, Semgrep CE, Trivy, and NuGet submission passed. No release or package was prepared; operator-data, integration, and install-channel acceptance remain open.

The schema-v4 audit pins BookshelfNG source `2811718076d84777a1b1132e4e5d2abd21231229` to ChaptarrNG target `cfaaa418199662fad7d209aa5f4e62bceb723148`. It covers 732 post-fork commits (723 absent from pinned upstream history) and 1,119 changed paths: 81 reviewed mappings and 603 reviewed dispositions (177 retained, 129 equivalent, 125 ported, and 172 non-runtime retirements). Another 516 paths remain open (143 without mapped targets and 373 requiring semantic review). This is path-level coverage, not feature-parity proof; no runtime retirement is approved. Keep BookshelfNG in service; representative data, rollback, provider fulfillment, installed channel handoff, and operator acceptance remain open. No release or bridge was published.
