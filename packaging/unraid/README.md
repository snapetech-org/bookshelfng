# BookshelfNG for Unraid

This repository publishes the standalone BookshelfNG Unraid Docker template.
**Built on .NET 10 LTS**, BookshelfNG is a Snapetech NG fork of Bookshelf for
ebook and audiobook library management and acquisition. It works independently;
SeerrNG integration is optional.

> **Final release:** BookshelfNG `0.4.21.71` is published. The latest public ChaptarrNG release is `v0.9.977`; it accepts migration-158 SQLite and rejects older schemas. The unreleased older-schema SQLite and one-schema PostgreSQL candidate is in [ChaptarrNG PR #131](https://github.com/snapetech-org/chaptarrng/pull/131); follow it for current exact-head validation.
>
> PostgreSQL smoke run [39128352662](https://github.com/snapetech-org/chaptarrng/actions/runs/39128352662) on head `e908227b` exited during application startup before the 300-second readiness limit. Its safe receipt contained a DryIoc interpreter method token, but no verified exception class, underlying cause, or NUnit totals; the converter result is unknown. Follow PR #131 for current diagnostics; corrected class/frame reporting is being validated on head `7eb58085`. Do not use the candidate with operator data.
>
> BookshelfNG's fail-closed release gate merged to `main` as `c6b4642`; its readiness variable remains unset and the published `.71` release remains the final release. Populated-data migration, rollback, and the Community Apps upgrade flow remain unaccepted.

## Existing installations

Keep the current BookshelfNG image until you are ready to migrate. The legacy
Community Apps template on `main` still points to BookshelfNG. A transition
candidate keeps the existing BookshelfNG entry, appdata path, port, media and
download mappings, user IDs, timezone, and Hardcover settings while switching
to the standard ChaptarrNG image. It is not published and must remain on its
feature branch until the application release and Unraid update-flow gates
pass. The XML and settings-preservation check passed; run
`python3 scripts/test-transition-template.py` to repeat it. Read the
[BookshelfNG-to-ChaptarrNG migration guide](https://github.com/snapetech-org/bookshelfng/blob/main/docs/migrate-from-bookshelfng-to-chaptarrng.md),
upgrade BookshelfNG to `.71`, stop the service, and keep an independent
appdata backup before switching. New installations should use the
[ChaptarrNG Unraid template](https://github.com/snapetech-org/chaptarrng-unraid).
For a manual BookshelfNG install needed to inspect or roll back an existing
library, use [the legacy template XML](templates/bookshelfng.xml); it installs
`ghcr.io/snapetech-org/bookshelfng:main`.

- Map persistent appdata to `/config` and your media to `/data`.
- Map downloads to `/download`, matching your download client's container paths.
- Set a personal Hardcover API token in `HARDCOVER_AUTH` or BookshelfNG settings.
- Open the web interface on port 8787 and configure indexers and download clients.
- One instance can manage ebooks and audiobooks. SeerrNG can use two service
  entries with the same URL and API key when requesting both formats.
- Existing Readarr or softcover databases require migration before using the
  Hardcover image; changing the image tag alone is not a migration.
